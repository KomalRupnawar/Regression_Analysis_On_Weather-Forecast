# Regression_Analysis_On_Weather-Forecast
# Aim:  
Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm used for the prediction of parameter which is in continuous nature. In Regression Analysis 
On Weather Forecast project, linear regression has been used for finding the relationship between Temperature and Humitidity. 
# Objective:
The objective of regression analysis On Weather Forecast is to find the relationship between Humidity And temperature.
# Methodology:
Data Collection : I have collected the Regression_Analysis_On_Weather_Forecast  from Kaggle.

Data Cleaning : In this step we prepare the data for further analysis by find missing values and removing null values , transforming and standardizing our data.

Exploratory Data Analysis : After cleaning process we study the discriptive statastic , visualize data based on how they related to each other.

Model Development : In this stage we undergo the use of machine learning algorithm to model .
#Tools And Technology:
Python

jupyter Notebook

Python Libraries : Pandas , Numpy , Matplotlib ,rcparams, Sklearn.
# Conclusion:
After fitting the linear regression model ,we can conclude that their is low corrleation between Temperature And Humidity.
